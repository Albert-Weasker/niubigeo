## You shipped a product. Does AI know it exists?

More users now ask AI directly instead of clicking through a page of search results:

> What tools should I use?  
> What products exist in this category?  
> What are the alternatives to this product?  
> Which one should I choose?

Your website may already be indexed by search engines, but AI may still:

- miss your brand entirely;
- misunderstand your positioning;
- remember only part of your product;
- recommend competitors first;
- cite third-party pages while ignoring your official site.

NiubiGEO does not hide this behind an unexplained score. It shows the questions, answers, competitors, and sources so you can understand how AI sees your market.

## What you get from one audit

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### How AI understands your brand

See which models recognize your brand, how they describe your product, and what they leave out.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Who AI treats as competitors

When users do not mention your brand, see which products AI brings up instead. NiubiGEO separates confirmed competitors from loosely related names.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Where your brand is missing

Find customer questions where competing products appear and your product does not.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

### Which sources shape the answer

Review the official, community, and third-party sources cited by AI, then open the original answer behind each conclusion.

</td>
</tr>
</table>

**Data source:** Community Edition generates results with the provider API you configure. Every conclusion links back to the question, model answer, and citation sources behind it.

## A report founders can actually read

NiubiGEO does not require you to understand a pile of GEO metrics. The report answers plain business questions:

```text
Summary
├── Does AI recognize your product?
├── How does AI describe your brand?
├── Who are the confirmed competitors?
├── Which questions surface competitors more often?
├── Which important questions miss your brand?
└── Which sources support these conclusions?
```

The main report stays focused on readable conclusions. Full AI answers are collapsed by default and can be opened when you want to inspect the evidence.

## Why open source?

We want every team to understand how they appear in AI answers at a low cost, with a way to verify every conclusion.

NiubiGEO lets you:

- self-host for free and use your own provider keys;
- review every test question before it runs;
- open the original AI answer behind each conclusion;
- inspect how brands, competitors, and citation sources were identified.

## 3-minute audit

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Albert-Weasker/niubigeo.git
cd niubigeo
cp .env.example .env
```

Add at least one provider key to `.env`:

```env
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
GEMINI_API_KEY=
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=
```

Start the app:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787), enter a domain, confirm the brand, competitors, and questions, then run the audit.

You can also pull the published image:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/albert-weasker/niubigeo:v0.1.0-alpha
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Run with Node.js</strong></summary>

NiubiGEO requires Node.js 22 or newer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Albert-Weasker/niubigeo.git
cd niubigeo
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm run self-check
npm run server
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Run from CLI</strong></summary>

```bash
npm run audit -- \
  --domain example.com \
  --provider openrouter \
  --models openai/gpt-4o-mini,perplexity/sonar \
  --prompt-count 8
```

Add keywords and your own customer questions:

```bash
npm run audit -- \
  --domain example.com \
  --keywords "category keyword,buyer intent keyword" \
  --competitors rival.com,other.com \
  --prompts "What are the best tools in this category?|What are the alternatives?"
```

Reports are saved in the local `runs/` directory by default.

</details>

## Supported providers

| Provider | Status | How it is used |
|---|:---:|---|
| OpenRouter | Supported | One key can run models from multiple providers |
| OpenAI | Supported | Uses the official OpenAI API key |
| Anthropic | Supported | Uses the official Anthropic API key |
| Google Gemini | Supported | Uses the official Gemini API key |
| Perplexity | Supported | Search and citation behavior is controlled by the provider |
| DeepSeek | Supported | Capabilities depend on the selected model and endpoint |
| OpenAI-compatible API | Planned | For custom gateways and compatible local services |

## Packages

The Docker image is published on GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/albert-weasker/niubigeo:v0.1.0-alpha
docker pull ghcr.io/albert-weasker/niubigeo:latest
```

## Bilingual by design

NiubiGEO supports English and Simplified Chinese. The language setting affects:

- the product interface;
- automatically generated monitoring questions;
- prompts sent to the provider;
- brand and competitor analysis;
- the final report.

## NiubiGEO vs commercial AI visibility tools

Commercial AI visibility platforms are usually a better fit for teams ready to buy hosted software, proprietary datasets, and team workflows. NiubiGEO is for teams that want to start with open source, control their models and questions, and keep the evidence close.

The comparison below is based on public information from each product's official website, last checked on **2026-09-03**. Product capabilities change over time; verify current details on the vendor's own website.

### NiubiGEO vs Profound

- **Choose Profound:** Best for organizations that need hosted enterprise monitoring, mature marketing workflows, and large-scale data capabilities.
- **Choose NiubiGEO:** Best for teams that want to start free, self-host, choose their own models, and inspect the underlying evidence.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Enter domain] --> B[Discover brand and competitors]
    B --> C[Confirm real customer questions]
    C --> D[Call provider APIs]
    D --> E[Analyze answers and sources]
    E --> F[Generate readable report]
```

1. Enter a domain or product page.
2. NiubiGEO identifies the brand, aliases, category, keywords, and possible competitors.
3. The user confirms or edits the questions before any provider call.
4. The system calls the configured provider API.
5. NiubiGEO analyzes the target brand, competitors, recommendations, and provider-returned sources.
6. It generates a short, readable report where every conclusion links back to evidence.

## Project status

NiubiGEO is currently `v0.1.0-alpha`: the core flow works, while interfaces, data structures, and report rules may still change.

- [x] Multi-provider API audits
- [x] Question confirmation before audit
- [x] Brand and competitor discovery
- [x] Confirmed competitors separated from possibly related brands
- [x] Relevant source filtering
- [x] Reports traceable to AI answers
- [x] English and Simplified Chinese
- [ ] Scheduled monitoring
- [ ] Report comparison under the same audit conditions
- [ ] Report export package
- [ ] Provider Plugin SDK
- [ ] More providers and compatible endpoints

## Need to verify what real users see?

Community Edition is for running your own API visibility audits. If you also need:

- human testing across countries and regions;
- consumer web UI checks for ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, and similar products;
- screenshots, sources, and complete evidence packages;
- GEO optimization plans based on the competitive gaps found in the audit;

you can explore **NiubiGEO Managed Service, powered by the NiubiStar global user network.**

<details>
<summary><strong>View data source and result boundaries</strong></summary>

- Community Edition uses provider APIs and does not simulate consumer web UI results.
- API answers can differ from consumer product answers.
- Citations only come from provider responses or sources that appear in the AI answer.
- OpenRouter can call models from different providers, but the result is still labeled as OpenRouter API.
- Provider keys do not cross boundaries. For example, an OpenAI key only calls OpenAI, and a Gemini key only calls Gemini.
- Without a provider key, NiubiGEO does not produce AI visibility results.
- The core audit path never treats mock data as a substitute for real provider answers.
- AI answers are stochastic; one audit is not a permanent ranking.
- Human regional testing and consumer web UI verification are separate services.
