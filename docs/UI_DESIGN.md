# UI Design

This document defines the first public UI for NiubiGEO Community Edition.

The UI is not a marketing landing page and not a dense analytics backend. It is a self-hosted audit console that helps a user run one real AI visibility audit and understand the result.

## Product Promise

When a user enters one domain, NiubiGEO should answer:

```text
Does AI know this brand?
How does AI describe it?
Who appears instead?
Where does the brand disappear?
Which sources shaped the answers?
```

## Non-Negotiable Rules

1. Real provider data only.
   - No API key means no AI visibility result.
   - Empty states can guide setup, but must not show mock audit results.

2. One domain first.
   - The first version audits one target domain at a time.
   - Multi-brand dashboards and paid regional verification are outside the open-source UI.

3. Confirm before running.
   - The user must review brand, aliases, competitors, keywords, questions, provider, models, and language before API requests run.

4. Separate question meaning.
   - Brand awareness questions test whether AI recognizes a named brand.
   - Natural discovery questions test whether AI suggests the brand when the user does not name it.
   - Comparison questions test how AI compares the target with alternatives.

5. API source transparency.
   - API results must stay labeled as API results.
   - OpenRouter-routed results must be labeled as OpenRouter API results.
   - API results must not be presented as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity, or other consumer web UI results.

6. Bilingual must be real.
   - Language controls UI copy, generated questions, execution prompts sent to providers, and generated reports.

7. Reports must be human-readable.
   - Main reports do not show SOV, prompt IDs, run IDs, token cost, latency, raw JSON, or technical evidence sections.
   - Every main conclusion links to a supporting AI answer or source.

## Primary Flow

```text
New Audit
-> Discovery Result
-> Confirm Questions
-> Run Progress
-> Brand Competition Report
```

### 1. New Audit

Purpose: collect the minimum input needed to create an audit plan.

Required controls:

- Domain or URL.
- Provider/model selection.
- Language switch.
- Optional GitHub repository.
- Optional user keywords.
- Optional competitor list.
- Prompt count or audit size.

The primary action should generate a reviewable audit plan, not immediately run all provider calls.

### 2. Discovery Result

Purpose: show what the system thinks the target is.

Required content:

- Brand name.
- Aliases.
- Official domain.
- Category.
- Candidate competitors.
- Candidate keywords.

The user can edit every field before continuing.

### 3. Confirm Questions

Purpose: let the user decide whether the audit questions are meaningful.

Required sections:

- Brand awareness questions.
- Natural discovery questions.
- Comparison questions.
- Other questions.

Each question can be edited, disabled, deleted, or reclassified.

The summary must show:

- Total question count.
- Provider.
- Models.
- Language.
- Whether web search or provider citations are supported.
- Expected request count.

### 4. Run Progress

Purpose: make real provider execution visible.

Required states:

- Queued.
- Running.
- Completed.
- Failed.

The progress UI should show provider/model names and failures, but should not introduce dense scorecards before the report is generated.

### 5. Brand Competition Report

Purpose: let a non-technical founder understand the result in a few minutes.

Required structure:

```text
Summary
How AI sees you
Who competes with you
Competitive differences
Sources
Collapsed AI answer evidence
```

The report should answer the user's actual questions, not expose internal database fields.

## Report UI Rules

### Summary

Show one short conclusion and a compact model comparison table.

Good:

```text
Most models recognize the brand, but it rarely appears in natural discovery questions. One competitor appears more consistently.
```

Bad:

```text
Natural discovery rate is 24.4% and SOV is 31%.
```

### How AI Sees You

Show at most three short bullets:

- What AI thinks the product is.
- What AI remembers.
- What AI does not understand or misses.

Do not paste raw answer paragraphs into the main body.

### Who Competes With You

Split competitors into:

- Confirmed competitors.
- Possible related brands.

Only confirmed competitors may appear as primary competitors. Possible related brands must remain collapsed or secondary.

### Competitive Differences

Use neutral headings:

- Competitors appear more often in these scenarios.
- Your brand appears more often in these scenarios.
- Important questions where your brand does not appear.

If evidence is insufficient, say so directly.

### Sources

Show only the most important related sources in the main body.

Use collapsed "View all sources" for:

- Related sources.
- Possible sources.
- Excluded sources.

Irrelevant same-name or similar-name pages must not appear in the main source summary.

### AI Answer Evidence

Keep full AI answers collapsed by default.

Each answer should show:

- The question.
- The answer.
- Target brand appearance.
- Competitors mentioned.
- Sources cited.
- Provider and model.
- API source label.

Do not show internal answer numbers in the main report copy. Evidence links should say "View the supporting AI answer" or "查看支持这一结论的AI回答".

## Visual Direction

- Use a quiet operational layout.
- Prefer plain sections and compact tables.
- Use cards only for repeated items or report blocks.
- Avoid decorative dashboards and marketing hero sections.
- Keep text short enough for users to scan.
- Do not require users to understand GEO terminology.

## Public Alpha UI Acceptance

The UI passes when a first-time user can:

1. Enter one domain.
2. Configure a real provider key.
3. Review the generated audit questions.
4. Run a real provider audit.
5. Open a report and understand the result without reading technical metrics.
6. Click from any conclusion to supporting AI answers or sources.
