## Neutral keyword tests

Keyword tests were not run: the frozen selection yielded no eligible terms. Sources and exclusions remain in archiveContext.keywordManifest in public-evidence.json; no terms or runs were added.

K valid counts analyzable first-attempt answers only, not product metric denominators. Inspect archived metric samples, included flags and judgments. A later successful retry does not replace this coverage count.

Selection records, exact quotes and exclusions are in the evidence file. Each answer observes the target and other entities under the same conditions; offline and online differences are not model rankings.

## Repeated observations

1 archived measurement runs; this count does not imply all succeeded. Compare only identical model, language, search and fingerprint conditions. Short repeats do not establish a long-term trend or a causal effect.

## Limits and disclosure

This is a public-product observation. Inclusion does not imply a partnership or endorsement.

Model descriptions are not verified market facts. A returned source does not establish that its content is correct or caused a recommendation. Unknown, missing, analysis failure and request failure remain separate. Use the evidence to investigate descriptions or sources, not to assert optimization caused a difference.
